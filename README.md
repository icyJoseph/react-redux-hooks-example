# React-Redux Hooks v7 alpha-rel-4

This repository keeps track of react-redux v7.

Currently uses `^7.1.0-alpha.4`, which exposes, `useSelector`, `useDispatch` and `useStore`.

A count can be increased by the user and there's a tick happening every second which re-renders the component.

`useCallback` is heavily used to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of the `Count` child.
